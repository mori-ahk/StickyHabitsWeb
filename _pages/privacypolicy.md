# How we store your data?

<br>

## Personal data
We do not store any of your personal information nor do we send them anywhere. All of your data is stored on your iPhone. Nothing goes out of your iPhone and nothing comes in. Everything happens in your iPhone. 
## App Crash Analytics
We use the Apple's built-in crash reporting service. The only information availiable to us is your device model details and the date that the crash occured.
## Contact us
If you have any questions about how we store your data, please [contact us](mailto:ahmadik.morteza95@gmail.com)
